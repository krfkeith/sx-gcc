# Status #

There already exists a framework within the regular GCC 4.2.2 tree that allows to compile an SX cross compiler on i386 / x86\_64 architectures (others have not been tested!).

We do regular tests and the current results can be found at :

Currently the largest number of the tests that fail are in the "libstdc++" group. They can roughly be categorized in 4 groups:
  1. 16 test cases fail because of the [issue #138](https://code.google.com/p/sx-gcc/issues/detail?id=#138) in the sx-gcc bugtracker. We could fix them if we started using the SX format for quad precision floating point numbers instead of IEEE format.
  1. 4 test cases fail because of the [issue #141](https://code.google.com/p/sx-gcc/issues/detail?id=#141) in the sx-gcc bugtracker. These test cases fail only if the "-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections" switches are used when compiling the code.
  1. 39 test cases fail because of the [issue #139](https://code.google.com/p/sx-gcc/issues/detail?id=#139) in the sx-gcc bugtracker. These test cases fail to compile only if the "-g" switch is used when compiling the code (i.e. debugging info is enabled).
  1. the cause of failure for the rest of the test cases is unknown. Some more time would have to be spent to identify them.
