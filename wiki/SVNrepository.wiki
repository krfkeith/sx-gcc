#summary svn repository access

= SVN repository access =

Due to the large size of the needed SVN repository, we preferred to move it
out of the google-code framework.

The repositories will be switched to read-only mode soon, such that they will be
accessible to anybody. For write access please ask the project members.

For accessing the repositories use following URL for the SVN access:
  * sx-gcc: https://source.tree.se/sx/sx-gcc/svn/trunk
  * sx-binutils: https://source.tree.se/sx/sx-binutils/svn/trunk
