#summary SX memory access


= General =
 * Addressroom: 40bits=1TB
 * Pagesizes: 32k, 4m, 16m/64m '''Page Frames'''
 * Small pages only in lower 32GB (HW convention)/4GB (SW convention)
 * Byte address space, but natural aligned
 * '''Partial Space''' has 256 '''Page Franes''' (8M-16GB depending on pgae size
 * ''observation'': In Super-UX, a smallpage executable can not use more than 5 '''Partial Spaces'''

= ATB =
 * HW caching of '''partial spaces''' using '''ATB'''(address translation buffer), with 40 entries for 40 ''''partial spaces'''
 * if partial space is not in ATB, a '''missing space exception''' is raised.
 * no replacement policy implemented, has to be done in software
 * no usage information, so which partial space to remove?

= PTE =
 * see ''/sys/immu.h''
 * Page Table Entry has 32 bits
  * 20 bits PB (page base)
  * 1 bit for locking page in memory
  * 3 bits unused
  * 1 bit unused (hw convention)
  * 3 bits page attributes
  * 1 bit cache bypass flag
  * 1 bit write protection
  * 1 bit privileged bit
  * 1 bit unvailability 

= PTE discussion =
 * attributes not yet clear
 * no referended bit (minor problem)
 * no modified bit (major problem)
 * VAX has no modified bit either
