#summary Register Transfer Language

Internally the GNU compiler uses the RTL to represent the operations that it created while parsing the language to be compiled.
There are basically two representations for this language. One is a lisp-like language and the other one is a representation through C structures and pointers that comprise the language tree. The lisp-like language is a helpful tool to describe these C structures more easily and especially the operations that can be done with them.
 
The GNU compiler creates these RTLs from the language source files (and more intermediate representations) and uses them in the creation of back-end output. Every back-end has a so called [MachineDescription machine description] which describes how these RTLs are translated into assembly output for the target machine. The machine description also allows for entries that describe how a given RTL expression can be expanded into more RTL expressions if the target machine cannot directly handle the first one.
